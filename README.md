# Baby-Care-Product-Analysis
This project involves analyzing real-world FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) data to evaluate the performance of baby care products across various dimensions such as brands, package types, sizes, and SKUs. The goal is to provide management with a 360-degree view of product performance over time to support strategic decision-making.
